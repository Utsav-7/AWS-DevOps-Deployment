#  AWS CI/CD Pipeline for Random Password Generator

This document outlines a Continous Integration and Continous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for a random password generator on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The pipeline leverages AWS services to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

##  Project Structure

The project likely follows this structure:

* **source** - This directory contains the source code for the random password generator.
* **buildspec.yaml** - This file defines the build specifications used by AWS CodeBuild.
* **appspec.yaml** - This file defines the deployment configuration used by AWS CodeDeploy.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account with proper IAM permissions
* AWS CLI configured with access to your AWS account

##  Deployment Process

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered by a push to the main branch of the repository. Here's a breakdown of the pipeline stages:

1. **CodeCommit:** The code is stored in a CodeCommit repository.
2. **CodeBuild:** A push to the main branch initiates a CodeBuild project. This project uses the `buildspec.yaml` file to build the random password generator application.
3. **Testing:** After a successful build, automated tests are executed. These tests can be unit tests or integration tests written for the password generator.
4. **CodeBuild (Again):** If the tests fail, the pipeline stops and the build is marked as failed. Otherwise, the build continues.
5. **Amazon S3 (Optional):** If the application is packaged as an artifact, it's uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket at this stage.
6. **AWS CodeDeploy:** CodeDeploy retrieves the newly built artifact and deploys it to the target environment. The `appspec.yaml` file specifies the deployment configuration.
7. **Amazon EC2:** The application is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances.

##  Deployment with AWS CLI

To manually deploy the application using the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. Build the application:

```bash
aws codebuild start-build --project-name <project-name>
```

2. Once the build is successful, deploy the application:
```bash
aws deploy update-deployment-group --application-name <application-name> --deployment-group-name <deployment-group-name> --deployment-config <deployment-config-name>
```
Note: Replace `<project-name>`, `<application-name>`, and `<deployment-group-name>` with the actual names you configured in your AWS environment.




### Conclusion
- This is a basic example of a CI/CD pipeline for a random password generator on AWS. The specific implementation details may vary depending on your specific requirements and chosen technologies.
